# Logic Circuit Design

- Design a binary decoder circuit for a 7-segment display using the Logisim simulator. The decoder circuit must have variables P1, P2, P3 and P4 as inputs and variables a, b, c, d, e, f and g as outputs.
- Output variables must be linked to the 7-segment display available in Logisim.
